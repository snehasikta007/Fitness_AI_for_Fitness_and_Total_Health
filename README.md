Health Coach AI is a web application delivering personalized fitness and nutrition guidance through AI-driven recommendations. It empowers users to achieve health goals with tailored workout plans, meal suggestions, and progress tracking.

The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while Python with the Flask framework is used for backend development. MongoDB is used as the database for storing user and health data, and RESTful APIs are implemented for communication between the frontend and backend. 

The application is developed in a local development environment using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor. The backend server runs on Flask. MongoDB is used locally or via cloud services.
